# Runtime — `@fusengine/harness/runtime`

The loop that makes the package behave like the Claude plugin, on any harness.

## `handleHook(id, payload, opts)`

The single entry point a hook calls (via `harness hook <id>`):

```ts
import { handleHook } from "@fusengine/harness/runtime";

const { stdout, exit } = await handleHook(id, payload, {
  now: Date.now(),
  cwd: process.cwd(),
  refsDir: process.env.FUSE_HARNESS_REFS,
  windowMs: resolveTtlSec(process.env) * 1000, // FUSE_ENFORCE_TTL_SEC (default 2 min)
});
```

- **PRE event** → MCP cache intercept (a fresh cached context7/exa hit is served
  **and** recorded as doc-consulted), then `gate()`: stateless guards → trivial-edit
  fast path → APEX gates (from the track) → native response via `respond(id, prompt)`.
- **POST event** → `activityFor(event)` → `recordActivity` (fills the track; agent
  `quality` is derived from the response length), and `mcpPostStore` caches responses.
- **UserPromptSubmit** (payload carries `prompt`) → `promptText(payload.prompt)`
  normalizes the field first (`./prompt-text.ts`) — a plain string on Claude
  Code/Codex passes through unchanged, but Kimi 0.31.1 sends an array of
  content blocks (`[{type,text}]`), which is flattened by joining each
  block's `.text` with `"\n"`; anything else yields `""`, never a throw — then
  `detectCreationIntent` → `recordBrainstormRequired` (`brainstormGate` fires
  on the next edit). Kimi then uses the legacy `handleConfirmSubmit`; Codex
  processes the same reply before scope-specific early returns and binds it to
  a versioned action identity (tool, canonical cwd, canonical command). Its
  atomic consumed receipt authorizes sibling callbacks sharing one
  `tool_use_id`; it proves authorization at PreToolUse, not command execution.
  See [adapters.md](./adapters.md#confirm-code--recourse-for-a-degraded-ask).

`normalizeEvent(id, payload)` unifies the payload shapes. Cursor has a dedicated
branch for its native events: top-level `beforeShellExecution.command` and
`preToolUse` `Shell` both become `Bash`, `Write` becomes `Edit`, and
`afterFileEdit.edits[]` becomes ordered per-edit post fan-out. That post fan-out
improves observation and framework detection only; it cannot block an edit that
already happened. Claude/Codex/Gemini keep `tool_name`+`tool_input`, and Cline
keeps its nested `preToolUse` shape.

## `gate(input)`

The composable gate, independent of any harness:

```ts
const prompt = await gate({
  sessionId, framework: "react", tool: "Write",
  filePath: "src/Button.tsx", content,
  refs,                 // from loadRefs(FUSE_HARNESS_REFS)
  now: Date.now(), trackFile,
});
```

Returns the first blocking `Prompt`, or `null` to allow. The trivial-edit fast
path lets up to `TRIVIAL_BUDGET` (4) tiny non-`replace_all` edits per window
through without the APEX gates. The gate reads the existing **on-disk** line count
so an `Edit` on an already-oversized file blocks; pass `agentType` to exempt
`Explore`/`Plan` agents.

After the stateless guards, the gate runs **effectful** checks (each fail-open):
`preCommitGate` (runs eslint/tsc/prettier/ruff on a `git commit`), `modularGate`
(Next.js `modules/` and Laravel FuseCore structure + cross-module imports), and
`dryGate` (greps the codebase for duplicate declarations). The design-agent
pipeline is dispatched separately and is inert unless a design agent is active —
see [design.md](./design.md).

## Tracking (`./tracking`)

The session track feeds the stateful gates. An adapter records activity on POST
and the gate reads it on PRE:

- `recordAgent(track, name, ts, quality?)` — `insufficient` quality is ignored by `agentsFresh`.
- `recordDoc` / `recordRefRead` — doc consultation + SOLID ref reads.
- `recordTrivialEdit` / `trivialCount` — sliding-window trivial-edit counter.
- `recordBrainstormRequired` — set from `detectCreationIntent(prompt)`.

`activityFor(event)` maps a live tool-use to the activity to record (MCP doc →
`doc`, `Task`+`subagent_type` → `agent`, a `.md` read → `ref`).

## Storage & MCP

State splits across two roots — don't assume everything is under one directory:

- **Session track + gate sidecars — out-of-tree.** `defaultStateDir(cwd)` /
  `trackFile(sessionId, dir)` (`./runtime/paths.ts`) resolve to
  `~/.fuse-harness/state/<8-char-md5-of-project-path>/` — deliberately outside
  the repo, so the protected-path guard never has to bless writes to its own
  enforcement state. `handle.ts` derives the track file this way
  (`trackFile(event.sessionId, defaultStateDir(opts.cwd))`), and the one-shot
  metric sidecar (`one-shot.json`) lives alongside it in the same directory.
- **MCP/WebFetch cache + curated lessons — in-tree.** `projectLayout(root)`
  (`./config/layout.ts`) resolves `<root>/.harness/{cache,memory}`:
  `cacheDir` for the MCP/WebFetch response cache, `memoryDir`/`lessonsFile` for
  `MEMORY/LESSON.md`. `.harness/` is gitignored except `memory/LESSON.md`
  (`STATE_GITIGNORE`), which is meant to be committed.
- `mcpPreIntercept` returns `{ stdout, docSource? }`: it serves a fresh cached
  MCP/WebFetch result (deny + content) or caps verbosity (exa `numResults`/`tokensNum`,
  Context7 `tokens`). A served context7/exa hit reports `docSource`, so `handleHook`
  records the doc consultation (the cache counts as consulted). `mcpPostStore`
  caches the response. See `./cache`.

## Multi-plugin fan-out (`./runtime/burst-window.ts`)

Every deployed sibling plugin registers its own hook for the same Claude event,
so one real tool call can spawn ~11 processes recording the same deny / one-shot
entry / sniper reminder within milliseconds. `BURST_DEDUP_MS` (2000ms) treats a
same-operation-hash record landing inside that window as the same event rather
than a new one — this is a heuristic tuned to the observed fan-out latency, not
a protocol guarantee. See `deny-loop.ts`'s `dedupMs` param and `one-shot.ts`'s
`burstFirst` for the two consumers.

## PRD coordination (`./runtime/prd`)

Opt-in (`FUSE_PRD=1`), documented in full at [prd.md](./prd.md). Five
dispatch-point exports, each wired as one call into an existing dispatch
point, plus two internal helpers (`prd-identity.ts`'s
`resolvePrdIdentity`, `prd-candidate-files.ts`'s `prdCandidateFiles`) used
only by `prd-pre-gate.ts` — both re-exported from the `./runtime/prd`
barrel but not separate call sites:

- `prd-pre-gate.ts`'s `prdPreGate` → one line in `handle-pre.ts`, ahead of
  the rest of the PRE pipeline — allows an authorized PRD write (bypassing
  `gate()` entirely) or returns the ownership deny.
- `prd-post-check.ts`'s `prdPostCheck` → one line in `handle-post.ts`,
  after the existing per-file loop — runs the cross-check when a task PRD
  or the router just changed.
- `prd-subagent-context.ts`'s `prdSubagentContext` → folded into
  `lifecycle/dispatch.ts`'s `SubagentStart` case — injects the starting
  agent's own file/sub-task slice.
- `prd-subagent-stop.ts`'s `prdSubagentStopGate` → `lifecycle/dispatch.ts`'s
  `SubagentStop` case, ahead of `trackAgentMemory` (returned only when the
  gate is a no-op) — one-shot block on an incomplete sub-task.
- `prd-stop-gate.ts`'s `prdStopGate` → `lifecycle/dispatch.ts`'s `Stop`
  case (`core` scope), before `stopCore` — one-shot block on an
  unresolved cross-check violation.

## Sidechain evidence harvest (`SubagentStop`)

Sub-agent `PostToolUse` hooks don't reliably fire on Claude Code (documented
platform issues #43612/#27655/#34692). `SubagentStop` — which *is* reliably
dispatched on the main session — parses the finishing sub-agent's own
`agent_transcript_path` and backfills its research/explore calls and `.md` ref
reads into the session track **before** the freshness gate runs next
(`src/freshness/evidence-harvest-io.ts`, wired in `dispatch.ts`'s `SubagentStop`
case). This is a per-checkpoint reconciliation, not a continuous fix for the
underlying hook-reliability gap.
