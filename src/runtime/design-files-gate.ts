/**
 * @module design-files-gate
 * Gates for multi-file write primitives (Codex `apply_patch`, fanned into
 * `event.files` by normalize.ts): apply_patch IS the Write tool under Codex,
 * so the design pipeline must see it. Per op, because `content` means
 * different things (apply-patch.ts:10-15):
 *  - add:    content IS the full new document — content-gated like a Write;
 *  - update: content is the hunk's new side, APPROXIMATE, never the document —
 *            only content-independent gates run (path, state-file, phase/quota).
 *            No BLOCKING or DEGRADING validation on this path — promote-only:
 *            the POST re-reads the real file, a clean content promotes to
 *            phase 3, a dirty one changes nothing. And it would not bite
 *            anyway: designSystemValid is consumed ONLY under
 *            FUSE_DESIGN_GEMINI=1 (off by default — an informational flag),
 *            and designSystemExists is never read after init;
 *  - delete: skipped (parity with the sibling applyPatchGate).
 * One violating file blocks the whole envelope. `htmlCssOnlyGate` NOW applies
 * here too (owner D2 revised): the two write paths must not diverge on what
 * the design agent may write — an `apply_patch` `.tsx`/`.astro`/etc. add or
 * update is just as much a framework-file write as the same content via
 * `Write`/`Edit`, and letting it through only on this path was an unintended
 * apply_patch-shaped bypass, not a deliberate relaxation. KNOWN GAPS
 * (documented, still out of scope): apply_patch also bypasses
 * uiDesignSkillGate and the Gemini create_frontend precondition;
 * `Design-System.md` (case) escapes every endsWith check, here and on
 * Write — a real bypass on case-insensitive macOS, not widened now; and
 * `*** Move to:` (apply-patch.ts:76-79) unconditionally OVERWRITES `cur.path`
 * on ANY preceding op (`Add File`/`Update File`), so a `*** Update File: a.css`
 * + `Move to: a.tsx` sequence surfaces here as `filePath` ending in `.tsx`
 * (correctly blocked — NOT a bypass, verified against the parser). The
 * un-verified direction is the reverse: `Add File: a.tsx` + `Move to: a.css`
 * would surface only the PERMITTED destination extension while `f.content`
 * is real framework code — the source path is never preserved anywhere, and
 * this gate (like Write's htmlCssOnlyGate) checks only the extension, never
 * the content's actual syntax. Whether Codex's real grammar allows Move-to
 * after an Add (vs. Update-only) is unconfirmed; flagged, not fixed here.
 * Also: the POST side still does NOT run `runDesignChecks` (tsx/jsx/css
 * warnings) on an `apply_patch` file — `handle-post.ts` keeps `designGate` on
 * the RAW, un-fanned envelope there (recordPost's apply_patch branch is
 * promote-only and resolves `design-system.md` via `join(cwd, …)`; routing a
 * fanned Write/Edit-shaped event through it instead would read `filePath`
 * UNRESOLVED and risk degrading the state — a real regression, not a
 * hypothetical one). Restoring the tsx/jsx/css warning would require
 * resolving relative apply_patch paths AND preserving the promote-only
 * doctrine inside `recordPost` at the same time — out of scope here, owner
 * decision.
