/**
 * @module store
 * Session-track persistence — TWO modes behind an env kill-switch:
 * - JOURNAL (default): writes append signed event lines to `track-<sid>.log`
 *   (O_APPEND, lock-free — see track-journal.ts), reads fold the log over the
 *   legacy `track-<sid>.json` snapshot. No lock on the hot path ⇒ the fan-out
 *   can no longer lose a write to "track lock busy, write skipped" — compaction
 *   included (it is rename-atomic, see track-compact.ts).
 * - LEGACY (`FUSE_TRACK_JOURNAL=0`): the original locked read-modify-write,
 *   kept fully intact below as the instant rollback (G1) — no redeploy needed.
 *   NOTE: =0 does NOT honour the uncompacted journal (the track reads as its
 *   last snapshot, possibly EMPTY); the events are recoverable by switching
 *   back to journal mode — never delete a `.log` during a =0 rollback.
 * The flag is read at CALL time so the switch is live.
 * @packageDocumentation
