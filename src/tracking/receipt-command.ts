/**
 * @module receipt-command
 * Command-SHAPE rules for {@link classifyReceipt} (`./receipts`): which
 * command text is even eligible to be scored as a receipt at all, and which
 * runner (if any) it resolves to. Split out of `./receipts` to keep it under
 * the SOLID line ceiling.
 *
 * Threat model (explicit): these rules guard against FORGETTING to verify
 * and against honest shortcuts — a run whose output/exit code was
 * accidentally discarded, an informational invocation, a filtered run. They
 * are NOT a security control against an agent that deliberately fabricates
 * tool output, same caveat as the `CONFIRM` code in the README ("a guard
 * against accidental/hasty …, not a security control against an adversarial
 * agent").
 *
 * Structural rule (replaces the old `EXIT_MASK_RE` blacklist): the recognised
 * runner must be the LAST command of the line — {@link lastListSegment}
 * splits the unquoted command on `;`, `&&`, `||`, a lone job-control `&`, and
 * newline (never a bare pipe, which still carries the runner's real output
 * forward) and only the LAST segment is searched. `bun test && git commit -m
 * x` and `bun test || true` both null: the runner sits in an EARLIER segment
 * only. `cd x && bun test` and `bun test 2>&1 | tail -5` both still resolve:
 * the runner is in (or is) the last segment either way.

/**
 * A flag/subcommand that runs zero (or an unbounded, still-running) tests, or

 * `--list-tests` (jest/swift/dart), `--watch`/`--watchAll`/`--watch-all`

 * is NOT here: it skips the BUILD step only, the tests still run — treating
 * it as informational was a false negative (real defect, fixed).
 *
 * `(?!=false)` excludes `--watch=false`/`--watchAll=false`/`--watch-all=false`
 * — Vitest's own config docs list `--watch=false` alongside `-w`/`--watch` as
 * an explicit CLI form (the option defaults to `true`), and Jest's
 * `--watchAll[=false]` is the documented way to force run-once mode on a
